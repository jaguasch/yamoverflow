How do I connect to the alternate/oob vpn?

https://www.yammer.com/microsoft.com/#/inbox/show?threadId=303154328

the oobfw is a cisco ASA5505 that's setup a dedicated 10mb cogent line for OOB access in case the kenpocalypse happens (like this morning). Internally, you can access it at oobfw1. I sent you a message with a temporary password. Please login into oobfw1, and change your password by going into configure mode, and running a command like "username jsheridan password $MAH_NEW_PASSWORD! privilege 15" -- then write memory

Additionally, the settings for actually being able to VPN into it -- you need to configure it as an IPSec VPN endpoint from within Mac OS X control panel.
